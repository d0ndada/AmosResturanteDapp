## Setup and Deployment with Ganache
This DApp is designed for deployment using Ganache, a personal Ethereum blockchain for development purposes. To set it up:

1. Install Ganache:
If you haven't installed Ganache yet, download and install it from Ganache's official website.

2. Deploy the Contract:
Launch Ganache and set up a workspace.
Using your preferred development environment or tools like Truffle, deploy the contract.

3. Extract ABI and Contract Address:
Post-deployment, you will need the ABI and the contract address. These are typically found in the JSON file generated by the compilation of your smart contract. This file is often located in a directory named build/contracts or similar.
Open this JSON file, and you will find the ABI array and the contract address.

4. Update config.js with ABI and Contract Address:
Navigate to the Restaurant DApp's directory and open the config.js file (or the respective configuration file if named differently).
Locate the placeholders meant to store the restaurant's contract ABI and address.
Replace the existing ABI array and address with the new ABI and the address of the deployed contract from the JSON file.
Save and close the file.

>**Note**: Make sure to update both the ABI and contract address accurately to ensure that your DApp can interact with the contract on the Ganache network correctly.

1. Run the DApp:
With the ABI and contract address updated in config.js, you can now run the Restaurant DApp locally. It will interact with the Ganache blockchain.
For a detailed deployment procedure and contract interactions, refer to the documentation or review the setup process used in the Todo DApp with Ganache.
